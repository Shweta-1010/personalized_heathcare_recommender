# 🩺 Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System** leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to assist users in predicting diseases and recommending appropriate medicines based on symptoms.  
It provides an interactive, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface that allows patients to enter their health details and receive tailored predictions.

The system also integrates an **SQL-based user authentication module** and a **data analytics dashboard** to visualize patterns and patient data insights. It's a beginner level project.

## 🚀 Key Features
1. **Secure Login System**
   - SQL-based user authentication.
   - Clean login UI with light-mode theme.
   - Direct access to disease prediction after login.

2. **Disease Prediction Module**
   - Predicts possible diseases based on user input (age, blood pressure, glucose, heart rate, and symptoms).
   - Age field supports both manual entry and increment/decrement buttons.
   - Utilizes ML techniques for prediction and analysis.

3. **Medicine Recommendation Engine**
   - Suggests most relevant medicines for detected symptoms using ML similarity models.
   - Dynamically filters and recommends **only the most common medicines** among the given symptoms.

4. **Interactive Analytics Dashboard**
   - Displays insights through **bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps**, and more.
   - Visualizes disease prediction trends, medicine usage, and patient behavior.
   - Built with **Plotly** for dynamic and modern visualization.

5. **Clean UI/UX**
   - Light and vibrant color palette.
   - Responsive layout and neat component spacing using **Streamlit** and **custom CSS styling**.
